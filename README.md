# test_svg_files_for_rotrics
A repository of test SVG vector image files for Rotrics DexArm (All-in-One Desktop Robotic Arm)

All the drawings in this repository are drawn by my daughter. She drew those sketches with the "CONCEPT" app on iPad Pro and then exported as SVG file. Please feel free to use/distribute them. They are all relatively small and simple, so quite useful for testing Rotrics DexArm's pen module or laser engraver module.

You can create your own SVG vector image files with your iPad + Apple Pencil if you own them. (I am pretty sure there are other drawing or sketching apps that support exporting in SVG format, but CONCEPT app is the one I found first).

There is a trick creating a SVG file with CONCEPT app. If you export the entire project then the backgroud paper will also be exported and because the background is so big, your drawings will appear tiny in the Rotrics Studio software. To prevent this, just select drawings you would like to export in the CONCEPT app then export choosing an option ("export only selections"). Then only the drawings will be included in the output SVG file.

Have fun!
